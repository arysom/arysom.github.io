{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>As a seasoned php dev, I made the first instance of this blog in <a href=\"https://sculpin.io\">Scuplin</a>. Why not? Php can do. Writing was easy, just get the subject and let it flow. But there were some technical problems. With deploying (git submodule, what the heck?!). I could do that, I could also build my frontend with some tooling, custom gulp, custom webpack and so on. Looking wistfully towards jekyllrb and it's gems I was almost ready to switch to it, but custom theme development could be too much. And some months later I've looked into the basic React tutorial on codeacademy. There was some hype around GatsbyJS, so I thought, why not?! All that counts in building your own techie blog are some markdown files with content. You could present them any way you like.</p>\n<p>And here it is. I daily work with php system - drupal. And I've read that gatsby could use drupal as a data source. But I've stopped here. Just to have some separate sandbox and feed my brain with something different that I usually do. The graphQL, how cool is that? Combining restful api's oposite to graphQL - and only for using a static site generator. There's also a huge ecosystem of plugins to check, offering newest technologies these days - service workers, ssr, link prefetching among the others - and all things that you could think of.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/gatsby-exchange/","date":"2019-02-10"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Changing blog engine to gatsbyjs"}}},"pageContext":{"singlePost":true}}
